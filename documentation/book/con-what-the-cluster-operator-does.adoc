= Overview of the Cluster Operator component

The Cluster Operator is responsible for deploying a Kafka cluster alongside a Zookeeper ensemble.

To deploy a Kafka cluster:

* A `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration is created within the Kubernetes cluster.
* The Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster, based on what is declared in the `Kafka` resource.

For more information on the configuration options supported by the `Kafka` resource, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-str[].

The Cluster Operator can also deploy:

* A Topic Operator to provide operator-style topic management via `KafkaTopic` custom resources.
* A Kafka Connect cluster to connect to an existing Kafka cluster.

NOTE: On OpenShift, a Kafka Connect deployment can incorporate a Source2Image feature to provides a convenient way to include connectors.
