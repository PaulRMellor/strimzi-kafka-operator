= Watch options for a Cluster Operator deployment

When the Cluster Operator is running, it starts to _watch_ Kafka resources for updates.

Depending on the deployment, the Cluster Operator can _watch_ Kafka resources from:

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-{context}[A single namespace (the namespace it is installed)]
* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-to-watch-multiple-namespaces{context}[Multiple namespaces]
* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-to-watch-whole-cluster-{context}[All namespaces]

NOTE: {ProductName} provides example YAML files to make the deployment process easier.

Cluster Operator watches the following resources:

* A `Kafka` resource for the Kafka cluster.
* A `KafkaConnect` resource for the Kafka Connect cluster.
* A `KafkaConnectS2I` resource for the Kafka Connect cluster with Source2Image support.
* A `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource for the Kafka Mirror Maker instance.

When a new `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaConnectS2I`, or `Kafka Mirror Maker` resource is created in the Kubernetes cluster, the operator gets the cluster description from the desired resource and starts creating a new Kafka, Kafka Connect, or Kafka Mirror Maker cluster by creating the necessary other Kubernetes resources, such as StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps, and so on.

Every time the desired resource is updated by the user, the operator performs corresponding updates on the Kubernetes resources which make up the Kafka, Kafka Connect, or Kafka Mirror Maker cluster.
Resources are either patched or deleted and then re-created in order to make the Kafka, Kafka Connect, or Kafka Mirror Maker cluster reflect the state of the desired cluster resource.
This might cause a rolling update which might lead to service disruption.

Finally, when the desired resource is deleted, the operator starts to undeploy the cluster and delete all the related Kubernetes resources.
