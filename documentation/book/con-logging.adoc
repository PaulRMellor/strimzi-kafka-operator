= Logging

Use the `logging` property to configure loggers and logger levels.

You can set the log levels by specifying the loggers and their levels directly (inline) or use a custom (external) ConfigMap.

Here we see examples of `inline` and `external` logging:

include::snip-configmap-logging-{kind}.adoc[]

include::snip-inline-logging-{kind}.adoc[]
