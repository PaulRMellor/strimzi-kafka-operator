= {oauth} token based authentication flow

Support for {oauth} extends the Kafka SASL_OAUTHBEARER mechanism, which is used to establish an authenticated sessions with a Kafka broker.

A Kafka client initiates a session with the Kafka broker using the SASL_OAUTHBEARER mechanism for credentials exchange.

For {oauth}, credentials are exchanged using an access token.
The Kafka broker must be configured for {oauth} support in order to validate the token received during session initiation.

A Kafka client can have the access token configured directly on deployment, without contact with an {oauth} authorization server.

If the Kafka client is not configured with an access token, for the client to authenticate with the authorization server to obtain a token it can provide either of the following:

* Client ID and secret
* Client ID, refresh token and (optionally) a secret

NOTE: Other information, such as `scope` to limit access might also be provided.
