= Deploying an {oauth} authorization server

This procedure describes how to deploy an authorization server and configure it for integration with Strimzi.

User credentials are managed by an authorization server using realms, which describe security policies.

To use {oauth} with Strimzi, you need a deployment of an authorization server to be able to create and manage authentication realms.

NOTE: If you already have an authorization server deployed, you can skip the deployment step and use your current deployment.

.Prerequisites

* Strimzi and Kafka is running

For the OAuth deployment:

* Check the supported configuration for the authorization server
* Installation requires a user with cluster-admin role, such as system:admin

.Procedure

. Deploy the authorization server to your cluster.
. Use the authorization server to configure authentication credentials for:
+
--
.. Kafka brokers
.. Each of your client applications
--
+
The steps are dependent on the authorization server.
+
Depending on the chosen xref:con-oauth-authentication-client-options-{context}[authentication flow], you can use the authorization server to:
+
* Configure brokers
* Configure and authorize clients
* Configure users
* Obtain access and refresh tokens
+
Consult the product documentation for the authorization server you choose.

.What to do next
After deploying the authorization server, xref:proc-oauth-broker-config-{context}[configure the Kafka brokers to use {oauth}].
