= Kafka Exporter configuration

You can configure the `Kafka` resource to support a Kafka Exporter deployment in your cluster.

Kafka Exporter extracts data for analysis as Prometheus metrics, primarily data relating to consumer lag.

For information on the Kafka Exporter and why it is important to monitor consumer lag for performance, see xref:assembly-kafka-exporter-str[Kafka Exporter].
