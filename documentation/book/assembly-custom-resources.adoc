= Custom resources
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) extend the Kubernetes API, providing definitions to create and add custom resources to an {ProductPlatformName} cluster. Custom resources are created as instances of CRDs.

For {Productname}, CRDs introduce custom resources specific to {Productname} to an {ProductPlatformName} cluster, such as Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kafka Mirror Maker, and users and topics.  CRDs provide configuration instructions, defining the schemas used to instantiate and manage the resources specific to {Productname}. CRDs also allow {Productname} resources to benefit from native {ProductPlatformName} features like CLI accessibility and configuration validation.

CRDs require a one-time installation to a cluster. Depending on the cluster setup, installation typically requires cluster admin privileges.

NOTE: `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings` to manage the CRDs are applied on installation to provide access for the Cluster Operator.

CRDs and custom resources are defined as YAML files. Separate CRD files contain specifications for creating specific custom resources for {Productname}.

Custom resources are instantiated and validated using the specifications defined in a CRD.

WARNING: When CRDs are deleted, custom resources of that type are also deleted.
