= Authentication

Use the `consumer.authentication` and `producer.authentication` properties to configure authentication for the consumer and producer.

By default, Kafka Mirror Maker will try to connect to Kafka brokers without any authentication.

Use `authentication.type` to set the authentication mechanism, and add additional configuration details depending on the mechanism.

You can use different authentication mechanisms for the Kafka Mirror Maker consumer and producer.

== TLS Client Authentication

Use `type:tls` to configure Kafka Mirror Maker to use TLS authentication.

TLS client authentication uses a TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate is specified in the `certificateAndKey` property and is always loaded from a Kubernetes secret.
In the secret, the certificate must be stored in X509 format under two different keys: public and private.

NOTE: TLS client authentication can be used only with TLS connections.

For more information on configuring TLS encryption and authentication, see:

* xref:proc-configuring-kafka-mirror-maker-tls-{context}[Configuring TLS encryption in Kafka Mirror Maker]
* xref:proc-configuring-kafka-mirror-maker-authentication-tls-{context}[Configuring TLS client authentication in Kafka Mirror Maker]

== SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

Use `type:scram-sha-512` to configure Kafka Mirror Maker to use SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication.

The broker listener to which clients will connect must also be configured to use SASL SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password.
The `secretName` property contains the name of the `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

For more information on configuring SASL SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication, see xref:proc-configuring-kafka-mirror-maker-authentication-scram-sha-512-{context}[Configuring SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication in Kafka Mirror Maker].

== PLAIN authentication

Use `type:plain` to configure Kafka Mirror Maker to use PLAIN authentication.

The broker listener to which clients will connect must also be configured to use SASL PLAIN authentication.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

WARNING: The SASL PLAIN mechanism will transfer the username and password across the network in cleartext.
Only use SASL PLAIN authentication if TLS encryption is enabled.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password.
The `secretName` property contains the name of the `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

IMPORTANT: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.

The configuration steps are the same as described in xref:proc-configuring-kafka-mirror-maker-authentication-scram-sha-512-{context}[Configuring SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication in Kafka Mirror Maker].
