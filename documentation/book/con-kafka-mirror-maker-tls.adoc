= TLS encryption

Use the `consumer.tls` and `producer.tls` properties to configure TLS encryption for the consumer and producer.

By default, Kafka Mirror Maker will try to connect to Kafka brokers in source and target clusters using a plain text connection.
To use TLS encryption, use the `tls` property to provide a list of secrets with key names under which the certificates are stored in X.509 format.
