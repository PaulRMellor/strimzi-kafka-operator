= Kafka Exporter

The Kafka Exporter is provided with {ProductName} for deployment with a Kafka cluster to extract data on Kafka broker offsets.
The data is used in monitoring to help identify consumer lag and under-replication of brokers.

Lag data is exposed as Prometheus metrics, which can then be presented in Grafana for analysis.
