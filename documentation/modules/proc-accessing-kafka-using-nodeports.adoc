= Accessing Kafka using node ports

This procedure describes how to access a Strimzi Kafka cluster from an external client using node ports.

To connect to a broker, you need a hostname (advertised address) and port number for the Kafka _bootstrap address_,
as well as the certificate used for authentication.

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Configure a `Kafka` resource with an external listener set to the `nodeport` type.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    listeners:
      external:
        type: nodeport
        tls: true
        authentication:
          type: tls
        configuration:
          brokerCertChainAndKey: <2>
            secretName: my-secret
            certificate: my-certificate.crt
            key: my-key.key
          preferredAddressType: InternalDNS <3>
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
----
<2> Optional configuration for a xref:kafka-listener-certificates-str[Kafka listener certificate] managed by an external Certificate Authority. The `brokerCertChainAndKey` property specifies a `Secret` that holds a server certificate and a private key. Kafka listener certificates can also be configured for TLS listeners.
<3> Optional configuration to xref:con-kafka-broker-external-listeners-nodeports-{context}[specify a preference for the first address type used by Strimzi as the node address].

. Create or update the resource.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _KAFKA-CONFIG-FILE_
+
`NodePort` type services are created for each Kafka broker, as well as an external _bootstrap service_.
The bootstrap service routes external traffic to the Kafka brokers.
Node addresses used for connection are propagated to the `status` of each service.

. Retrieve the connection details to access the Kafka cluster.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl get kafka _KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_ -o=jsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.type=="external")].bootstrapServers}{"\n"}'
+
You need:
+
* The port number of the `NodePort` bootstrap service (`_KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-kafka-external-bootstrap`)
* The address of one of the kafka broker nodes
+
If different node addresses are returned, select the address type you want based on the following order:
+
--
. ExternalDNS
. ExternalIP
. Hostname
. InternalDNS
. InternalIP
--
+
Use the node address and port number (_NODE-ADDRESS:NODE-PORT_) in your Kafka client as the _bootstrap address_ to connect to the Kafka cluster.

. If TLS encryption is enabled, extract the public certificate of the broker certification authority.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl get secret _KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt
+
Use the extracted certificate in your Kafka client to configure TLS connection.
If you enabled any authentication, you will also need to configure SASL or TLS authentication.
