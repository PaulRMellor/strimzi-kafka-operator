= Accessing Kafka using OpenShift routes

This procedure describes how to access a Strimzi Kafka cluster from an external client outside of OpenShift using routes.

To connect to a broker, you need a hostname (advertised address) for the route _bootstrap address_,
as well as the certificate used for authentication.

Routes are used for HTTP access, so the port used to connect is always 443.

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Configure a `Kafka` resource with an external listener set to the `route` type.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    listeners:
      external:
        type: route
        # ...
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
----

. Create or update the resource.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
oc apply -f _KAFKA-CONFIG-FILE_
+
`ClusterIP` type services are created for each Kafka broker, as well as an external _bootstrap service_.
The bootstrap service routes external traffic to the Kafka brokers.
An OpenShift `Route` resource is also created for each service to expose them using the HAProxy load balancer.
DNS addresses used for connection are propagated to the `status` of each service.

. Retrieve the address of the bootstrap service to access the Kafka cluster.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
oc get routes _KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-kafka-bootstrap -o=jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}{"\n"}'
+
You need the address of the `Route` bootstrap service (`_KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-kafka-bootstrap`).
+
Use the route service address and port 443 (_ROUTE-ADDRESS:443_) in your Kafka client as the _bootstrap address_ to connect to the Kafka cluster.

. Extract the public certificate of the broker certification authority
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl get secret _KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt
+
Use the extracted certificate in your Kafka client to configure TLS connection.
If you enabled any authentication, you will also need to configure SASL or TLS authentication.
