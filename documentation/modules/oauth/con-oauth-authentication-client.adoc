= {oauth} Kafka client configuration
A Kafka client is configured with either:

* The Credentials required to obtain a valid access token from an authorization server (client ID and Secret)
* A valid long-lived access token or refresh token, obtained using tools provided by an authorization server

Credentials are never sent to the Kafka broker.
The only information ever sent to the Kafka broker is an access token.
When a client obtains an access token, no further communication with the authorization server is needed.

The simplest mechanism is authentication with a client ID and Secret.
Using a long-lived access token, or a long-lived refresh token, adds more complexity as there is additional dependency on authorization server tools.

NOTE: If you are using long-lived access tokens, you can configure the client in the authorization server to increase the maximum lifetime of the token.

If the Kafka client is not configured with an access token directly, the client exchanges credentials for an access token during Kafka session initiation by contacting the authorization server.
The Kafka client exchanges either:

* Client ID and Secret
* Client ID, refresh token, and (optionally) a Secret
