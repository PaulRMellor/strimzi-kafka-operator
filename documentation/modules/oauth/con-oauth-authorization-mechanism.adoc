= {oauth} authorization mechanism

{oauth} authorization uses {oauth-server} Authorization Services REST endpoints to extend token-based authentication with {oauth-server} by applying defined security policies on a particular user,
and providing a list of permissions granted on different resources for that user.
Policies use roles and groups to match permissions to users.
{oauth} authorization enforces permissions locally based on the received list of grants for the user from {oauth-server} Authorization Services.

== Kafka broker custom authorizer

A {oauth-server} _authorizer_ (`KeycloakRBACAuthorizer`) is provided with {ProductName}.
To be able to use the {oauth-server} REST endpoints for Authorization Services provided by {oauth-server},
a custom authorizer configuration is required on the Kafka Broker.

The authorizer fetches a list of granted permissions from the authorization server one-time-only,
and enforces authorization locally on the Kafka Broker, making rapid authorization decisions for each user session.
