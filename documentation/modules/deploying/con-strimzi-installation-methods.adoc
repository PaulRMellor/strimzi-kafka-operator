|Description

|xref:deploy-tasks_str[Installation artifacts (YAML files)]
|Download the release artifacts from {ReleaseDownload} {ZipDownload}.
Deploy the YAML installation artifacts to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`.
You start by deploying the Cluster Operator from `install/cluster-operator` to a single namespace, multiple namespaces, or all namespaces.

|xref:deploying-strimzi-from-operator-hub-str[OperatorHub.io]
|Use the *Strimzi Kafka* operator in the OperatorHub.io to deploy the Cluster Operator. You then deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.

|xref:deploying-cluster-operator-helm-chart-str[Helm chart]
|Use a Helm chart to deploy the Cluster Operator. You then deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.

For the greatest flexibility, choose the installation artifacts method.
The OperatorHub.io method provides a standard configuration and allows you to take advantage of automatic updates.
Helm charts provide a convenient way to manage the installation of applications.
