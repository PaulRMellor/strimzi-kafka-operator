= Operator deployment best practices

[role="_abstract"]
Potential issues can arise from installing more than one Strimzi operator in the same Kubernetes cluster, especially when using different versions.
Each Strimzi operator manages a set of resources in a Kubernetes cluster. 
When you install multiple Strimzi operators, they may attempt to manage the same resources concurrently. 
This can lead to conflicts and unpredictable behavior within your cluster.
Conflicts can still occur even if you deploy Strimzi operators in different namespaces within the same Kubernetes cluster. 
While namespaces provide some level of resource isolation, certain resources managed by the Strimzi operator, such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and roles, are cluster-scoped. 

Additionally, installing multiple operators with different versions can result in compatibility issues between the operators and the Kafka clusters they manage. 
Different versions of Strimzi operators may introduce changes, bug fixes, or improvements that are not backward-compatible. 

To avoid the problems associated with installing multiple Strimzi operators in a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend the following:

* Install the Strimzi operator in a separate namespace from the Kafka cluster and other Kafka components it manages to ensure clear separation of resources and configurations.
* Use a single Strimzi operator to manage all your Kafka instances within a Kubernetes cluster.
* Update the Strimzi operator and the supported Kafka version as often as possible to reflect the latest features and enhancements.

By following these best practices and deploying a single Strimzi operator with regular updates, you can ensure more stable management of your Kafka instances within a Kubernetes cluster while benefiting from the latest functionality and capabilities of Strimzi.
