= Deploying the Cluster Operator from OperatorHub.io

{OperatorHub} is a catalog of Kubernetes Operators sourced from multiple providers.
It offers you an alternative way to install stable versions of Strimzi using the Strimzi Kafka Operator.

The {OperatorLifecycleManager} is used for the installation and management of all Operators published on {OperatorHub}.

To install Strimzi from {OperatorHub}, locate the _Strimzi Kafka Operator_ and follow the instructions provided.

WARNING: Make sure you use the appropriate update channel.
If you are on a supported version of Kubernetes, installing Strimzi from the default _stable_ channel is generally safe.
However, we do not recommend enabling _automatic_ OLM updates.
An automatic upgrade will skip any necessary upgrade steps.
For example, to upgrade from {ConvertAfterProductVersion} or earlier
you must first xref:assembly-upgrade-resources-{context}[update custom resources to support the `v1beta2` API version].
