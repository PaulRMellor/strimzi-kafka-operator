= Deploying the Cluster Operator from OperatorHub.io

{OperatorHub} is a catalog of Kubernetes Operators sourced from multiple providers.
It offers you an alternative way to install stable versions of Strimzi using the Strimzi Kafka Operator.

The {OperatorLifecycleManager} is used for the installation and management of all Operators published on {OperatorHub}.

To install Strimzi from {OperatorHub}, locate the _Strimzi Kafka Operator_ and follow the instructions provided.

WARNING: Make sure you use the appropriate update channel.
If you are on a supported version of the Kubernetes, installing Strimzi from the default stable channel is safe.
However, if you are using a version of Kubernetes that is unsupported, installing Strimzi from the stable channel is unsafe,
especially when automatic updates are enabled, as the cluster will receive automatic updates with new components that are unsupported by the Kubernetes release.
