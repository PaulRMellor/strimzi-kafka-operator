= Scheduling strategies

Kafka components can be scheduled onto Kubernetes nodes using affinity rules, tolerations, and topology constraints.  
These strategies help isolate workloads, optimize resource usage, and improve overall cluster performance.

The following scheduling techniques support different deployment goals:

Use pod anti-affinity to avoid critical applications sharing nodes::
Use pod anti-affinity to prevent critical applications from being scheduled on the same disk.  
In Kafka deployments, configure pod anti-affinity to ensure that Kafka brokers do not share nodes with other workloads, such as databases.

Use node affinity to schedule workloads onto specific nodes::
Kubernetes clusters often include nodes optimized for different workloads, such as CPU, memory, storage, or network.  
Node affinity enables scheduling Kafka components onto nodes that match specific labels, such as `beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type` or custom labels, to optimize performance and cost.

Use node affinity, taints, and tolerations for dedicated nodes::
To reserve nodes for Kafka, you can taint them to exclude them from general workloads. 
Kafka pods can still be scheduled onto these nodes by configuring:
+
--
* Tolerations, which allow the pods to bypass the taint.
* Node affinity, for the pods to run on those specific nodes.
--
+  
These settings direct Kafka pods to dedicated nodes while preventing other workloads from being scheduled there
This approach isolates Kafka from other workloads, reducing resource contention and improving stability.

You can apply these scheduling strategies in the `template.pod` property within the `spec` of a Strimzi custom resource. 
For Kafka brokers specifically, Strimzi provides a two-level configuration:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka.template.pod` +
Use this to set a cluster-wide default scheduling policy for all Kafka broker and controller pods.
* `KafkaNodePool.spec.template.pod` + 
Use this to set scheduling policy for a specific node pool. 
Any scheduling rules defined here override the cluster-wide default for the pods managed by that specific node pool.

Other Strimzi components have their own template properties for scheduling:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka.template.pod`
* `KafkaNodePool.spec.template.pod`
* `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.template.pod`
* `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.template.pod`
* `KafkaConnect.spec.template.pod`
* `KafkaBridge.spec.template.pod`
* `KafkaMirrorMaker2.spec.template.pod`

The following procedures provide configuration examples for the `Kafka` and `KafkaNodePool` resources. 
The same affinity and tolerations configurations shown in these examples can be applied to the `template.pod` property of any other component.

Scheduling properties follow the Kubernetes specification.
