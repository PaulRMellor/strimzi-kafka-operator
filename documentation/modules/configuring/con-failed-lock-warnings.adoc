= Lock acquisition warnings for cluster operations

[role="_abstract"]
The Cluster Operator ensures that only one operation runs at a time for each cluster by using locks. 
If another operation attempts to start while a lock is held, it waits until the current operation completes.

Operations such as cluster creation, rolling updates, scaling down, and scaling up are managed by the Cluster Operator.

If acquiring a lock takes longer than the configured timeout (`STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`), a warning message is logged:

.Example warning message for lock acquisition
[source,shell]
----
WARNING AbstractClusterOperations:290 - Failed to acquire lock for kafka cluster lock::kafka::myproject::my-cluster
----

In configurations where `STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS` and `STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` are set, occasional warnings may occur without underlying issues. 
Timed-out operations are retried during the next periodic reconciliation.

Persistent appearance of this warning, especially when no other operations should be running, might indicate a lock release error. 
Restarting the Cluster Operator can resolve such issues.
