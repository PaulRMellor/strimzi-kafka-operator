= Accessing and using logs

[role="_abstract"]
You can view logs for Strimzi operators and Kafka components without any configuration.
If you configure logging, you can control the volume and type of information shown. 
Logging filters further narrow output to specific resources.

Logs can help you:

* Confirm successful component startup
* Monitor cluster activity
* Diagnose issues such as connection failures, authorization errors, or replication problems

View logs with `kubectl` commands.
For example:

* View logs from a pod:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0
----

* Follow logs in real time:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs -f my-cluster-kafka-0
----

* View logs from a specific container in a pod:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs my-cluster-entity-operator-0 -c topic-operator
----
