= Configuring storage types

[role="_abstract"]
Use the `storage` properties of the `KafkaNodePool` custom resource to configure storage for a deployment of Kafka in KRaft mode.

== Configuring ephemeral storage

To use ephemeral storage, specify `ephemeral` as the storage type.  

.Example configuration for ephemeral storage
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaNodePoolApiVersion}
kind: KafkaNodePool
metadata:
  name: my-node-pool
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 3
  roles:
    - broker
  storage:
    type: ephemeral
  # ...
----

Ephemeral storage uses {K8sEmptyDir} volumes, which are created when a pod is assigned to a node. 
You can limit the size of the `emptyDir` volume with the `sizeLimit` property.

The ephemeral volume used by Kafka brokers for log directories is mounted at `/var/lib/kafka/data/kafka-log<pod_id>`.

IMPORTANT: Ephemeral storage is not suitable for Kafka topics with a replication factor of 1.

For more information on ephemeral storage configuration options, see the link:{BookURLConfiguring}#type-EphemeralStorage-reference[`EphemeralStorage` schema reference^].

== Configuring persistent storage

To use persistent storage, specify one of the following as the storage type:

* `persistent-claim` for a single persistent volume
* `jbod` for multiple persistent volumes in a Kafka cluster (Recommended for Kafka in a production environment)

.Example configuration for persistent storage 
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaNodePoolApiVersion}
kind: KafkaNodePool
metadata:
  name: my-node-pool
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 3
  roles:
    - broker
  storage:
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 500Gi
    deleteClaim: true
  # ...
----

Strimzi uses {K8sPersistentVolumeClaims} (PVCs) to request storage on persistent volumes (PVs). 
The PVC binds to a PV that meets the requested storage criteria, without needing to know the underlying storage infrastructure.

PVCs created for Kafka pods follow the naming convention `data-<kafka_cluster_name>-<pool_name>-<pod_id>`, and the persistent volumes for Kafka logs are mounted at `/var/lib/kafka/data/kafka-log<pod_id>`.

You can also specify custom storage classes ({K8SStorageClass}) and volume selectors in the storage configuration.

.Example class and selector configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
# ...
  storage:
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 500Gi
    class: my-storage-class
    selector:
      hdd-type: ssd
    deleteClaim: true
# ...        
----

Storage classes define storage profiles and dynamically provision persistent volumes (PVs) based on those profiles. 
This is useful, for example, when storage classes are restricted to different availability zones or data centers.
If a storage class is not specified, the default storage class in the Kubernetes cluster is used. 
Selectors specify persistent volumes that offer specific features, such as solid-state drive (SSD) volumes.

For more information on persistent storage configuration options, see the link:{BookURLConfiguring}#type-PersistentClaimStorage-reference[`PersistentClaimStorage` schema reference^].

[id='proc-resizing-persistent-volumes-{context}']
== Resizing persistent volumes

Persistent volumes can be resized by changing the `size` storage property without any risk of data loss, as long as the storage infrastructure supports it. 
Following a configuration update to change the size of the storage, Strimzi instructs the storage infrastructure to make the change. 

Storage expansion is supported in Strimzi clusters that use persistent-claim volumes.
Decreasing the size of persistent volumes is not supported in Kubernetes.
For more information about resizing persistent volumes in Kubernetes, see {K8sResizingPersistentVolumesUsingKubernetes}.

After increasing the value of the `size` property, Kubernetes increases the capacity of the selected persistent volumes in response to a request from the Cluster Operator.
When the resizing is complete, the Cluster Operator restarts all pods that use the resized persistent volumes.
This happens automatically.

In this example, the volumes are increased to 2000Gi.

.Kafka configuration to increase volume size to `2000Gi`
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaNodePoolApiVersion}
kind: KafkaNodePool
metadata:
  name: my-node-pool
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 3
  roles:
    - broker
  storage:
    type: jbod
    volumes:
      - id: 0
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 2000Gi
        deleteClaim: false
      - id: 1
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 2000Gi
        deleteClaim: false
      - id: 2
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 2000Gi
        deleteClaim: false
  # ...
----

Returning information on the PVs verifies the changes:

[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl get pv
----

.Storage capacity of PVs
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
NAME               CAPACITY   CLAIM
pvc-0ca459ce-...   2000Gi     my-project/data-my-cluster-my-node-pool-2
pvc-6e1810be-...   2000Gi     my-project/data-my-cluster-my-node-pool-0
pvc-82dc78c9-...   2000Gi     my-project/data-my-cluster-my-node-pool-1
----

The output shows the names of each PVC associated with a broker pod.

NOTE: Storage _reduction_ is only possible when using multiple disks per broker.
You can remove a disk after moving all partitions on the disk to other volumes within the same broker (intra-broker) or to other brokers within the same cluster (intra-cluster).


== Configuring JBOD storage

To use JBOD storage, specify `jbod` as the storage type and add configuration for the JBOD volumes.
JBOD volumes can be persistent or ephemeral, with the configuration options and constraints applicable to each type.

.Example configuration for JBOD storage 
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaNodePoolApiVersion}
kind: KafkaNodePool
metadata:
  name: my-node-pool
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 3
  roles:
    - broker
  storage:
    type: jbod
    volumes:
      - id: 0
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 100Gi
        deleteClaim: false
      - id: 1
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 100Gi
        deleteClaim: false
      - id: 2
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 100Gi
        deleteClaim: false
  # ...
----

PVCs are created for the JBOD volumes using the naming convention `data-<volume_id>-<kafka_cluster_name>-<pool_name>-<pod_id>`, and the JBOD volumes used for log directories are mounted at `/var/lib/kafka/data-<volume_id>/kafka-log<pod_id>`.

[id='proc-adding-removing-volumes-{context}']
== Adding or removing volumes from JBOD storage

Volume IDs cannot be changed once JBOD volumes are created, though you can add or remove volumes.
When adding a new volume to the to the `volumes` array under an `id` which was already used in the past and removed, make sure that the previously used `PersistentVolumeClaims` have been deleted.

Use Cruise Control to reassign partitions when adding or removing volumes.
