= Configuring inline logging

[role="_abstract"]
Use inline logging when you only need to adjust log levels for Strimzi components.

Inline logging is defined directly in the `spec.logging` property of the custom resource.
Use the loggers property to set the root logger level and levels for specific classes or loggers.

.Example inline logging configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
logging:
  type: inline
  loggers:
    rootLogger.level: INFO
# ...
----

When a resource managed by the Cluster Operator is updated, changes to inline logging are applied dynamically without requiring a pod restart.
