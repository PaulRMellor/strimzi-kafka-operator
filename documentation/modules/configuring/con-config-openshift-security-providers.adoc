= Applying security context to pods and containers on OpenShift

[role="_abstract"]
OpenShift uses security context constraints (SCCs) to control permissions for pods.
Security context constraints (SCCs) are composed of settings and strategies that control the security features a pod has access to.

By default, OpenShift injects security context configuration automatically.
In most cases, this means you don't need to configure security context for the pods and containers created by the Cluster Operator.  
Although it is possible to create your own SCCs.

For more information, see the {OpenShiftDocs}.
