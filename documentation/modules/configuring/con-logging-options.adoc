= Choosing a logging method

[role="_abstract"]
You configure logging in custom resources by setting the `spec.logging` property.

Two methods are available:

Inline logging::
* Define loggers and log levels directly in the resource.
* Suitable when you only need to adjust log levels.
* Quick to set up, but limited in flexibility.

External logging::
* Reference a `ConfigMap` that contains a complete `log4j2.properties` file.
* Suitable when you need advanced options, such as the following:
** Centralized, reusable configuration across resources
** Logging filters to target logs for a specific Kafka cluster, topic, or operator 
** Custom appenders and layouts

Which method should you use?

* Use inline logging for simple changes to log levels.
* Use external logging for complex, reusable, or filtered configurations.
