= Configuring Kafka Connect and MirrorMaker 2 for multiple instances

[role="_abstract"]
Property values for the Kafka Connect cluster group ID and internal topics are configured by Strimzi by default. 
If you are running multiple instances of Kafka Connect or MirrorMaker 2, which is based on Kafka Connect, you must change the default configuration of the following `spec.config` properties:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
# ...
spec:
  config:
    group.id: connect-cluster <1>
    offset.storage.topic: connect-cluster-offsets <2>
    config.storage.topic: connect-cluster-configs <3>
    status.storage.topic: connect-cluster-status  <4>
    # ...
# ...
----
<1> The Kafka Connect cluster group ID within Kafka.
<2> Kafka topic that stores connector offsets.
<3> Kafka topic that stores connector and task status configurations.
<4> Kafka topic that stores connector and task status updates.

NOTE: Values for the three topics must be the same for all instances with the same `group.id`.

Unless you change the default settings, each Kafka Connect instance connecting to the same Kafka cluster is deployed with the same values.
What happens, in effect, is all instances are coupled to run in a cluster and use the same topics.

If multiple instances try to use the same topics, they will not work as expected and generate errors.

If you wish to run multiple instances, change the values of these properties for each instance.
