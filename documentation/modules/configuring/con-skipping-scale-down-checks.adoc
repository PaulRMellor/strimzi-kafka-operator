= Skipping checks on scale-down operations

[role="_abstract"]
By default, Strimzi performs a check to ensure that there are no partition replicas on a broker before initiating a scale-down operation on a Kafka cluster. 
If replicas are found, the scale-down operation is blocked to prevent potential data loss. 
To fix this, no replicas must be left on the broker before trying to scale it down again.

However, there may be scenarios where you want to bypass this blocking mechanism.
Disabling the check might be necessary on busy clusters, for example, because new topics keep generating replicas for the broker.
This situation can indefinitely block the scaling down of clusters, even when brokers are nearly empty. 

You can bypass the blocking mechanism by annotating the `Kafka` resource for the Kafka cluster.
Annotate the resource by setting the `strimzi.io/skip-broker-scaledown-check` annotation to `true`:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
kubectl annotate Kafka my-kafka-cluster strimzi.io/skip-broker-scaledown-check="true"
----

This annotation instructs Strimzi to skip the scale-down check.
Replace `my-kafka-cluster` with the name of your specific `Kafka` resource.

To restart the check, remove the annotation:
