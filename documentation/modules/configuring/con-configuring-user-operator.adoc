= User Operator configuration properties

User Operator deployment can be configured using additional options inside the `userOperator` object.
The following properties are supported:

`watchedNamespace`::
The Kubernetes namespace in which the User Operator watches for `KafkaUser` resources.
Default is the namespace where the Kafka cluster is deployed.

`reconciliationIntervalSeconds`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations in seconds.
Default `120`.

`image`::
The `image` property can be used to configure the container image which will be used.
To learn more, refer to the information provided on link:{BookURLConfiguring}#con-common-configuration-images-reference[configuring the `image` property`^].

`resources`::
The `resources` property configures the amount of resources allocated to the User Operator.
To learn more, refer to the information provided on link:{BookURLConfiguring}#con-common-configuration-resources-reference[setting appropriate requests and limits^].

`logging`::
The `logging` property configures the logging of the User Operator.
To learn more, refer to the information provided on link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-user-operator-logging-reference[User Operator logging^].

`secretPrefix`::
The `secretPrefix` property adds a prefix to the name of all Secrets created from the KafkaUser resource. For example, `secretPrefix: kafka-` would prefix all Secret names with `kafka-`. So a KafkaUser named `my-user` would create a Secret named `kafka-my-user`.
