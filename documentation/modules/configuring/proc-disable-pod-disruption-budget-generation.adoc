= Disabling PodDisruptionBudget generation

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi automatically generates a `PodDisruptionBudget` resource for each of the following components:

* Kafka cluster
* Kafka Connect
* MirrorMaker 2
* Kafka Bridge

Each budget applies across all pods deployed for that component.

The Kafka cluster's `PodDisruptionBudget` covers all associated node pool pods.

To disable automatic `PodDisruptionBudget` generation, set the `STRIMZI_POD_DISRUPTION_BUDGET_GENERATION` environment variable to `false` in the Cluster Operator configuration. You can then define custom `PodDisruptionBudget` resources if needed.
For more information, see xref:ref-operator-cluster-{context}[].
