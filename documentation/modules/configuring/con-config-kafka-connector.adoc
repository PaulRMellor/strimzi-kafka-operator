= Configuring Kafka Connect connectors

[role="_abstract"]
The `KafkaConnector` resource provides a Kubernetes-native approach to management of connectors by the Cluster Operator.
To create, delete, or reconfigure connectors with `KafkaConnector` resources, you must set the `use-connector-resources` annotation to `true`  in your `KafkaConnect` custom resource.

.Annotation to enable KafkaConnectors
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaConnectApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-connect-cluster
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/use-connector-resources: "true"
  # ...
----

When the use-connector-resources annotation is enabled in your KafkaConnect configuration, you must define and manage connectors using `KafkaConnector` resources. These resources must be deployed in the same namespace as the Kafka Connect cluster they are associated with, and the Kafka cluster interacting with the external data system.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can manage connectors using the Kafka Connect REST API instead of `KafkaConnector` resources.
To use the API, you must remove the annotation to use `KafkaConnector` resources in the `KafkaConnect` the resource.

`KafkaConnector` resources are configured to connect to external systems and are deployed within the same Kubernetes cluster as the Kafka Connect and Kafka clusters that interact with the external data systems.

The configuration specifies how connector instances connect to external data systems, including any necessary authentication.
You must also specify the data to watch. 
For example, in a source connector, you might provide a database name in the configuration. 
Additionally, you can specify where the data should be placed in Kafka by defining a target topic name.

Use the `tasksMax` proeprty to specify the maximum number of tasks.
For instance, a source connector with `tasksMax: 2` might split the import of source data into two tasks.

To include external connector configurations, such as user access credentials stored in a secret, use the `externalConfiguration` property of the `KafkaConnect` resource. 
You can also load values using xref:assembly-loading-config-with-providers-str[configuration providers].
