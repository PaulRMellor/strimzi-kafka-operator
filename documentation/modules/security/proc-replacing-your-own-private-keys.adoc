= Replacing private keys used by your own CA certificates

This procedure describes how to renew CA certificates and keys you installed yourself, instead of using the certificates generated by the Cluster Operator.
Follow this procedure when you are changing the private keys used to sign the new CA certificates.

If you are using your own certificates, the Cluster Operator will not renew them automatically.
Therefore, it is important that you follow this procedure during the renewal period of the certificate in order to replace CA certificates that will soon expire.

The procedure describes the renewal of CA certificates in PEM format.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator is running.
* xref:installing-your-own-ca-certificates-{context}[Your own CA certificates and private keys are installed].
* You have new cluster and clients X.509 certificates and keys in PEM format.

.Procedure

Before going through the following steps, make sure that the CN (Common Name) of the new CA certificate is different from the current one.
For example, when the Cluster Operator renews certificates automatically it adds a _v<version_number>_ suffix to identify a version.
Do the same with your own CA certificate by adding a different suffix on each renewal.
By using a different key to generate a new CA certificate, retain the current CA certificate stored in the `Secret`.

. Update the corresponding `Secret` retaining the current CA certificate, adding the new CA certificate and updating the generation.
+
.. Edit the existing `Secret`:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
kubectl edit secret _CA-CERTIFICATE-SECRET_
+
_CA-CERTIFICATE-SECRET_ is the name of the `Secret`, which is `_KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-cluster-ca-cert` for the cluster CA certificate and `_KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-clients-ca-cert` for the clients CA certificate.
+
Following an example of the `Secret` related to the cluster CA certificate for a Kafka cluster named `my-cluster`.

.. Retain the current CA certificate.
+
Rename the current `ca.crt` field in the `data` section as `ca-__DATE__.crt`, where _DATE_ is the certificate expiry date in the format _YEAR-MONTH-DAYTHOUR-MINUTE-SECONDZ_.
For example `ca-2018-09-27T17-32-00Z.crt`.
Leave the value for the field as it is to retain the current CA certificate.

.. Encode your new CA certificate into base64.
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
cat _PATH-TO-NEW-CERTIFICATE_ | base64

.. Update the CA certificate.
+
Create a new `ca.crt` field in the `data` section of the `Secret` and copy the new CA certificate base64 encoded got from the previous step
+
.. Increase the CA certificate generation.
+
Updated the `strimzi.io/ca-cert-generation` annotation with a higher incremental value.
For example, change `strimzi.io/ca-cert-generation=0` to `strimzi.io/ca-cert-generation=1`.
+

.. Save changes and exit.
+
Save the changes to the `Secret` and exit.

. Update the corresponding `Secret` with the new CA key and generation.
+
.. Edit the existing `Secret`:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
kubectl edit secret _CA-KEY-SECRET_
+
_CA-KEY-SECRET_ is the name of CA key, which is `_KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-cluster-ca` for the cluster CA key and `_KAFKA-CLUSTER-NAME_-clients-ca` for the clients CA key.

.. Update the CA key.

Copy the new CA key base64 encoded got from the first step into the `ca.key` field of the `data` section in the `Secret`.
+
.. Increase the CA key generation.
+
Updated the `strimzi.io/ca-key-generation` annotation with a higher incremental value.
For example, change `strimzi.io/ca-key-generation=0` to `strimzi.io/ca-key-generation=1`.

When Strimzi generates certificates, the certificate and key generation annotations are automatically incremented by the Cluster Operator.
For manual renewal of your own CA certificates together with a new CA key, set the annotations with a higher incremental value.
The annotations need a value higher than the ones from the current Secret so the Cluster Operator can roll the pods and update the certificates and keys.
The `strimzi.io/ca-cert-generation` and `strimzi.io/ca-key-generation` have to be incremented on each CA certificate renewal.
