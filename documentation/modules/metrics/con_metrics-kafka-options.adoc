= Prometheus metrics configuration

Grafana dashboards are dependent on Prometheus JMX Exporter relabeling rules,
which are defined for Strimzi components as custom resource configuration.

A label is a name-value pair.
Relabeling is the process of writing a label dynamically. 
For example, the value of a label may be derived from the name of a Kafka server and client ID.

Strimzi provides xref:ref-metrics-config-files-{context}[custom resource configuration YAML files] with example relabeling rules.

|Example YAML file

|Kafka and ZooKeeper

|Kafka Connect
|`KafkaConnect` and `KafkaConnectS2I`
|`kafka-connect-metrics.yaml`

|Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0

NOTE: We show metrics configuration using `kafka-metrics.yaml` in this section, but the process is the same when configuring Kafka Connect using the `kafka-connect-metrics.yaml` file.
