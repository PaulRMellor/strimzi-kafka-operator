Use OpenTracing or OpenTelemetry with the Jaeger tracing system.

OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry provide API specifications that are independent from the tracing or monitoring system.

* The APIs are used to _instrument_ application code

* Instrumented applications generate _traces_ for individual transactions across the distributed system

* Traces are composed of _spans_ that define specific units of work over time

Jaeger is a tracing system for microservices-based distributed systems.

* Jaeger implements the tracing APIs and provides client libraries for instrumentation

* The Jaeger user interface allows you to query, filter, and analyze trace data
