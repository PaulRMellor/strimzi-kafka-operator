= Configuring Kafka Connect user authorization

This procedure describes how to authorize user access to Kafka Connect.

When simple authorization is being used to access Kafka connect, a Kafka Connect user requires access rights to the consumer group
and the internal topics of Kafka Connect.

Simple authorization uses ACL rules to provide the right level of access, which are handled by the Kafka `SimpleAclAuthorizer` plugin.
For more information on configuring a `KafkaUser` resource to use simple authorization, see xref:ref-kafka-user-using-uo[Kafka User resource].

NOTE: The default values for the consumer group and topics will differ when xref:con-kafka-connect-multiple-instances-{context}[running multiple instances].

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Edit the `authorization` property in the `KafkaUser` resource to provide access rights to the user.
+
For example, here we see access rights configured for the Kafka Connect topics and consumer group using the following `literal` name values:
+
[table,stripes=none]
|===
|Property |Name

|`offset.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-offsets`

|`status.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-status`

|`config.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-configs`

|`group`
|`connect-cluster`
