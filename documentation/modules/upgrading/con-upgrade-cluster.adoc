= Upgrading Kubernetes

[role="_abstract"]
If you are upgrading your Kubenerates cluster to a later supported version, do it before upgrading Strimzi.
Refer to the Kubernetes upgrade documentation to check the upgrade path and the steps to upgrade your nodes correctly.

You’ll need admin privileges to be able to upgrade your Kubernetes cluster.
As a Strimzi admin with permission to perform the upgrade, the basic steps are as follows:

. Back up your Kubernetes components
. Check and provision for any backwards incompatible changes in the release notes of the target version
. Upgrade the Kubernetes cluster manually or automatically

You'll probably want to upgrade the `kubectl` command-line tool to the latest version too.

You can upgrade Kubernetes with minimal downtime for Strimzi.
Consult the latest Kubernetes documentation for guidance on the upgrade process.
For a manual upgrade, you can choose to upgrade nodes, or remove old nodes and replace them with new nodes.

After you have verified that the Kubernetes cluster upgrade is successful, you can upgrade Strimzi.

If you used the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to install the Strimzi Operator from the _stable_ channel, Strimzi updates are discovered automatically after the Kubernetes upgrade.
If you have specified _automatic_ OLM updates, the Strimzi Operator will automatically upgrade to the version of Strimzi that was released for the upgraded Kubernetes cluster version.
If you are manually updating using OLM, you’ll need to approve the upgrade.

Otherwise, follow the required upgrade sequence depending on the method used to deploy Strimzi.

WARNING: We recommend using OLM's manual update policy for Strimzi.
You can then perform any required upgrade preparation steps before the upgrade.
An automatic upgrade can occur before performing these steps, which can cause issues with the performance of Strimzi.
