= Namespace deletion

Recovery from namespace deletion is possible because of the relationship between persistent volumes and namespaces.
A `PersistentVolume` (PV) is a storage resource that lives outside of a namespace.
A PV is mounted into a Kafka pod using a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC), which lives inside a namespace.

If a namespace is deleted unintentionally, you can recover it from a PV as long as it is still present.

A reclaim policy for a PV tells a cluster how to act when a namespace is deleted.
If the reclaim policy is set as _Delete_, PVs are deleted when PVCs are deleted with a namespace.

To ensure that PVs are not deleted when a namespace is deleted, the policy must be reset from _Delete_ to _Retain_.
You can also configure the `StorageClass` property used for dynamic volume allocation so that it creates the volumes with the appropriate reclaim policy.

NOTE: If you are using _Retain_ as the reclaim policy, but you want to delete an entire cluster, you need to delete the PVs manually.
Otherwise they will not be deleted, and may cause unnecessary expenditure.
