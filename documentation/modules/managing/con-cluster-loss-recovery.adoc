= Cluster loss

A cluster might be lost, for example, when using cloud computing services.
When a cluster is lost, you can use PVs to recover the cluster if they were preserved within the infrastructure.
The recovery procedure is the same as with namespace deletion, assuming PVs can be recovered and they were created manually.
