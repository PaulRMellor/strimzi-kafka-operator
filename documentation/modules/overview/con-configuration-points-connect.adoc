A basic Kafka Connect configuration requires a bootstrap address to connect to a kafka cluster and authentication details.

Connectors configuration describes the source input data and target output data to feed into and out of Kafka Connect.
The external source data must reference specific topics that will store the messages.

Connectors:: Kafka provides two built-in connectors:
+
--
* `FileStreamSourceConnector` streams data from an external system to Kafka, reading lines from an input source and sending each line to a Kafka topic.
* `FileStreamSinkConnector` streams data from Kafka to an external system, reading messages from a Kafka topic and creating a line for each in an output file.
--
+
You can create other connectors using connector plugins, which are a set of JAR files that define the implementation required to connect to certain type of external system.
+
You create a custom Kafka Connect image that uses new Kafka Connect plugins.

Topics:: Each Kafka Connect instance is configured by default with the same:
+
--
* Group ID for the Kafka Connect cluster
* Kafka topic to store the connector offsets
* Kafka topic to store connector and task status configurations
* Kafka topic to store connector and task status updates
--
+
If separate Kafka Connect instances are used, these settings must reflect each instance.
