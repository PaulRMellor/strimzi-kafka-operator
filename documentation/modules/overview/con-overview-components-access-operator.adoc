= Access Operator

[role="_abstract"]
If you are using the Cluster Operator to manage your Kafka cluster, you can deploy and use the Access Operator to manage the distribution of connection details 
Kafka instances and Kafka users are specified in a `KafkaAccess` resource.
Optionally, the names of the listeners used to connect to Kafka clusters can also be specified.
When the the resource is created, a service binding `Secret` is created to store the connection details and optional user credentials.
The secret can then be referenced by applications across different namespaces.
