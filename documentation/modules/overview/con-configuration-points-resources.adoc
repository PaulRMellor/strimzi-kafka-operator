= Custom resources

After a CRD has been created in your cluster, you can create custom resources based on its specification.

The custom resources for {ProductName} components have common configuration properties, which are defined under `spec`.

In this fragment from a Kafka topic custom resource, the `apiVersion` and `kind` properties identify the associated CRD.
The `spec` property shows configuration that defines the number of partitions and replicas for the topic.

.Kafka topic custom resource
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: my-topic
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  partitions: 1
  replicas: 1
  / ...
----

There are many additional configuration options that can be incorporated into a YAML definition, some common and some specific to a particular component.
