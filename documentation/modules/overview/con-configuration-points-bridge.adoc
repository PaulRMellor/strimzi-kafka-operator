= Kafka Bridge configuration

A Kafka Bridge configuration requires a bootstrap server specification for the Kafka cluster it connects to, as well as any encryption and authentication options required.

Kafka Bridge consumer and producer configuration is standard, as described in the {ApacheKafkaConsumerConfig} and {ApacheKafkaProducerConfig}. 

HTTP-related configuration options set the port connection which the server listens on.
