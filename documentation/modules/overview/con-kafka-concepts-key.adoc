Knowledge of the key concepts of Kafka is important in understanding how {ProductName} works.

Kafka uses brokers and topics to receive and store data in a Kafka cluster.
Within a broker, topics are used to store messages.
Topics are split by partitions, where data is written.
Partitions are replicated across topics for fault tolerance.

Broker:: A broker, sometimes referred to as a server or node, orchestrates the storage and passing of messages.
Topic:: A topic provides a destination for the storage and publication of a specific category of information.
Cluster:: A group of broker instances.
Partition:: A partition is a division of a topic that stores messages in order.
+
The number of partitions is defined by a topic _partition count_.
Partition leader:: A partition leader handles all message requests for a topic.
Partition follower:: A partition follower replicates the partition data of a partition leader.
+
Topics use a _replication factor_ to determine the number of replicated partitions on other brokers.
A topic requires at least one partition and one _in-sync_ replica partition.
+
An _in-sync_ replica ensures that a message is committed only after it has been successfully copied to the replica partition.
In this way, if the leader fails the message is not lost.
+
In the _Kafka brokers and topics_ diagram, _Partition 0_ in _Topic 1_ is a partition leader, and _Partition 0_ in _Topic 2_ and _Topic 3_ are followers.
