= Distributed tracing

Within a Kafka deployment, distributed tracing using Jaeger is supported for:

* MirrorMaker to trace messages from a source cluster to a target cluster
* Kafka Connect to trace messages consumed and produced by Kafka Connect

Template configuration properties are set for the Kafka resources, which describe tracing environment variables.

.Tracing for Kafka clients
Client applications, such as Kafka producers and consumers, can also be set up so that transactions are monitored.

Client tracing requires:

* Tracing dependencies in the client `pom.xml` configuration file
* A Jaeger tracer initialized for the client application to use
* _Instrumentation_ code to describe the tracing profile in the client code
