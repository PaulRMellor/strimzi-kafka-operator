= Configuring listeners to connect to Kafka brokers

[role="_abstract"]
Listeners are used for client connection to Kafka brokers.
Strimzi provides a generic `GenericKafkaListener` schema with properties to configure listeners through the `Kafka` resource.

The `GenericKafkaListener` provides a flexible approach to listener configuration.
You can specify properties to configure _internal_ listeners for connecting within the Kubernetes cluster or _external_ listeners for connecting outside the Kubernetes cluster.

Each listener is xref:proc-config-kafka-{context}[defined as an array in the `Kafka` resource].
You can configure as many listeners as required, as long as their names and ports are unique.
You can configure listeners for secure connection using authentication.

== Configuring internal listeners

Internal listeners connect clients to Kafka brokers within the Kubernetes cluster.
An `internal` type listener configuration uses a headless service and the DNS names given to the broker pods. 

You might need to join your Kubernetes network to an outside network.
In which case, you can configure an `internal` type listener (using the `useServiceDnsDomain` property) so that the Kubernetes service DNS domain (typically `.cluster.local`) is not used.

You can also configure a `cluster-ip` type of listener that exposes a Kafka cluster based on per-broker `ClusterIP` services.
This is a useful option when you can't route through the headless service or you wish to incorporate a custom access mechanism. 
For example, you might use this listener when building your own type of external listener for a specific Ingress controller or the Kubernetes Gateway API. 

== Configuring external listeners

Configure external listeners to handle access to a Kafka cluster from networks that require different authentication mechanisms.

You can configure external listeners for client access outside a Kubernetes environment using a specified connection mechanism, such as a loadbalancer or route.

== Providing listener certificates
You can provide your own server certificates, called _Kafka listener certificates_, for TLS listeners or external listeners which have TLS encryption enabled.
For more information, see xref:kafka-listener-certificates-str[Kafka listener certificates].

NOTE: If you scale your Kafka cluster while using external listeners, it might trigger a rolling update of all Kafka brokers. This depends on the configuration.
