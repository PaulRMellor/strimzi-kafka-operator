Strimzi simplifies the process of running link:https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^] within a Kubernetes cluster.

This guide serves as an introduction to Strimzi, outlining key Kafka concepts that are central to operating Strimzi. 
It briefly explains Kafka's components, their purposes, and configuration points, including security and monitoring options. 
Strimzi provides the necessary files to deploy and manage a Kafka cluster, along with link:{BookURLDeploying}#config-examples-{context}[example configuration files^] for monitoring your deployment.

== Kafka capabilities

Kafka's data stream-processing capabilities and component architecture offer:

* High-throughput, low-latency data sharing for microservices and other applications
* Guaranteed message ordering
* Message rewind/replay from data storage to reconstruct application state
* Message compaction to remove outdated records in a key-value log
* Horizontal scalability within a cluster
* Data replication to enhance fault tolerance
* High-volume data retention for immediate access

== Kafka use cases

Kafka's capabilities make it ideal for:

* Event-driven architectures
* Event sourcing to log application state changes
* Message brokering
* Website activity tracking
* Operational monitoring through metrics
* Log collection and aggregation
* Commit logs for distributed systems
* Stream processing for real-time data responses

== How Strimzi supports Kafka

Strimzi provides container images and operators for running Kafka on Kubernetes.
These operators are designed with specialized operational knowledge to efficiently manage Kafka on Kubernetes.

Strimzi operators simplify:

* Deploying and running Kafka clusters
* Deploying and managing Kafka components
* Configuring Kafka access
* Securing Kafka access
* Upgrading Kafka
* Managing brokers
* Creating and managing topics
* Creating and managing users

For detailed information and instructions on using operators to perform these operations, see the guide for link:{BookURLDeploying}[Deploying and Managing Strimzi^].

== Why use Strimzi to run Kafka on Kubernetes?

Running Kafka on Kubernetes without native support from Strimzi can be complex.
While deploying Kafka directly with standard resources like `StatefulSet` and `Service` is possible, the process is often error-prone and time-consuming. 
This is especially true for operations like upgrades and configuration updates.
Strimzi dramatically reduces this complexity, providing the following advantages:

Native Kubernetes integration::
Strimzi transforms Kafka into a Kubernetes-native application.
It extends the Kubernetes API with Custom Resources (CRs) like `Kafka`, `KafkaTopic`, and `KafkaUser`. 
Custom resources offer a stable and highly configurable way to manage Kafka.
This allows you to define Kafka components at a high level, while the Strimzi operators automatically manage the underlying Kubernetes resources for you.
This native approach lowers the barrier to adoption and reduces operational overhead, making it easier to deploy and manage Kafka with less manual effort.

Declarative cluster management:: 
Manage the lifecycle of your Kafka resources declaratively. 
Declarative control allows you to manage resources like topics and users directly in YAML. 
This supports an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) workflow where Kafka configuration can be version-controlled, audited, and deployed through automated pipelines for a more consistent and repeatable setup.

Support for upgrade, scaling, and recovery::
Strimzi operators automate rolling upgrades and recovery of Kafka components, helping to reduce manual intervention and downtime. 
They also support scaling of Kafka clusters through node pools, automated partition reassignment using Cruise Control to maintain balanced workloads, and safe node removal using the Strimzi Drain Cleaner.

Integrated support for data streaming pipelines::
When Strimzi is installed, you can deploy and manage Kafka clusters alongside supporting components such as Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker 2, and Kafka Bridge, all using Kubernetes-native custom resources. 

Integrated security:: 
Strimzi enables fine-grained access control through listener-level authentication, cluster-wide authorization, and network policies. 
It simplifies certificate management to support TLS encryption with configurable protocols and cipher suites, and manages secure client access through `KafkaUser` resources with ACLs, quotas, and handling of credentials.
