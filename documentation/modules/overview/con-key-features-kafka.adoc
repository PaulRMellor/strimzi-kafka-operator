When deployed as a cluster, the underlying data stream-processing capabilities and component architecture of Kafka can deliver:

* Message ordering guarantees
* Message rewind/replay from data storage to reconstruct an application state
* Message compaction to remove old records when using a key-value log
* Horizontal scalability in a cluster configuration
* Replication of data to control fault tolerance
* Retention of high volumes of data for immediate access
