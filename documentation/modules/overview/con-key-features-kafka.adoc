= Kafka capabilities

A {ProductName} distribution provides the files to deploy and manage a Kafka cluster, as well as example files for configuration and monitoring of your deployment.

The underlying data stream-processing capabilities and component architecture of Kafka can deliver:

* Message ordering guarantees
* Message rewind/replay from data storage to reconstruct an application state
* Message compaction to remove old records when using a key-value log
* Horizontal scalability in a cluster configuration
* Replication of data to control fault tolerance
* Retention of high volumes of data for immediate access
