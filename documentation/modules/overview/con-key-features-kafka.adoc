= Kafka capabilities

The underlying data stream-processing capabilities and component architecture of Kafka can deliver:

* Allows microservices and other applications to share data with extremely high throughput and low latency
* Message ordering guarantees
* Message rewind/replay from data storage to reconstruct an application state
* Message compaction to remove old records when using a key-value log
* Horizontal scalability in a cluster configuration
* Replication of data to control fault tolerance
* Retention of high volumes of data for immediate access

= Kafka use cases

Kafka's capabilities make it suitable for:

* Stream processing so that applications can respond to data in real time
* Integration of microservices through an event-driven publish-subscribe architecture
* Streaming of analytics and activity tracking through metrics and log collection
