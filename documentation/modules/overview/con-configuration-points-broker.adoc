= Kafka cluster configuration

A kafka cluster comprises one or more brokers.
For producers and consumers to be able to access topics within the brokers, Kafka configuration must define how data is stored in the cluster and the type of access.
You can configure a Kafka cluster to run with multiple broker nodes across _racks_.

Storage::
Kafka and ZooKeeper store data on disks.
+
{ProductName} requires block storage.
Three types of data storage are supported:
+
--
Ephemeral (Recommended for development only):: Ephemeral storage stores data for the lifetime of an instance. Data is lost when the instance is restarted.
Persistent:: Persistent storage relates to long-term data storage independent of the lifecycle of the instance.
JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks, suitable for Kafka only):: JBOD allows you to use multiple disks to store commit logs in each broker.
--
+
The persistent storage capacity used by an existing Kafka cluster can be increased.

Listeners:: The following types of listener are supported:
Listeners configure how clients connect to a Kafka cluster.
+
* *Plain listener* that does not use encryption
* *TLS listener* that uses encryption
* *External listener* for access outside of Kubernetes

Rack awareness:: Rack awareness is a configuration feature that distributes Kafka broker pods and topic replicas across _racks_, which represent data centers or racks in data centers, or availability zones.
