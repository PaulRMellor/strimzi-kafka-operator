= Kafka cluster configuration

A Kafka cluster configuration describes how data is stored and accessed.

Storage::
Kafka and ZooKeeper store data on disks.
+
{ProductName} requires block storage and is designed to work optimally with cloud-based block storage solutions.
Three types of data storage are supported:
+
* Ephemeral (Recommended for development only)
* Persistent
* JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks, suitable for Kafka only)
+
The persistent storage capacity used by an existing Kafka cluster can be increased.

Listeners:: The following types of listener are supported:
Listeners configure how clients connect to a Kafka cluster.
+
* *Plain listener* that does not use encryption
* *TLS listener* that uses encryption
* *External listener* for access outside of Kubernetes

Rack awareness:: You can configure a Kafka cluster to run with multiple broker nodes across _racks_.
+
Rack awareness is a configuration feature that distributes Kafka broker pods and topic replicas across _racks_, which represent data centers or racks in data centers, or availability zones.
