= Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)

[role="_abstract"]
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are a set of security standards established by the US government to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data and information that is processed or transmitted by information systems. 
Strimzi automatically enables FIPS mode on the OpenJDK used in its container images when running on a FIPS-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

NOTE: If you don't want to use FIPS, you can disable it in the deployment configuration of the Cluster Operator using the `FIPS_MODE` environment variable.
