= Entity Operator configuration properties

The Entity Operator can be configured using the `entityOperator` property in `Kafka.spec`

The `entityOperator` property supports several sub-properties:

* `tlsSidecar`
* `topicOperator`
* `userOperator`
* `template`

The `tlsSidecar` property can be used to configure the TLS sidecar container which is used to communicate with ZooKeeper.
For more details about configuring the TLS sidecar, see xref:assembly-tls-sidecar-{context}[].

The `template` property can be used to configure details of the Entity Operator pod, such as labels, annotations, affinity, tolerations and so on.

The `topicOperator` property contains the configuration of the Topic Operator.
When this option is missing, the Entity Operator is deployed without the Topic Operator.

The `userOperator` property contains the configuration of the User Operator.
When this option is missing, the Entity Operator is deployed without the User Operator.
