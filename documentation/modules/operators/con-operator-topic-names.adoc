= Topic naming conventions

A `KafkaTopic` resource includes a name for the topic and a label that identifies the name of the Kafka cluster it belongs to. 

.Label identifying a Kafka cluster for topic handling
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaTopicApiVersion}
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: topic-name-1
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  topicName: topic-name-1  
----

The cluster name is derived from the `Kafka` resource.
If the label does not match the Kafka cluster, the Topic Operator cannot identify the `KafkaTopic`, and the topic is not created.

Kafka and Kubernetes have their own naming validation rules, and a Kafka topic name might not be a valid resource name in Kubernetes.
If possible, try and stick to a naming convention that works for both.

Consider the following guidelines:

* Use topic names that reflect the nature of the topic
* Be concise and keep the name under 63 characters
* Use all lower case and hyphens
* Avoid special characters, spaces or symbols

In the `KafkaTopic` resource, the Kafka topic name is specified using `metadata.name`.
However, if the Kafka topic name is not a valid Kubernetes resource name, you can use the `spec.topicName` property as an alias that works in Kubernetes. 
When absent, this name defaults to the `metadata.name` of the topic.
Topic names cannot be changed later.

.Example of supplying a valid Kafka topic name
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaTopicApiVersion}
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: My.Topic.1 # <1>
spec:
  topicName: my-topic-1 # <2>
  # ...
----
<1> Kafka topic name uses upper case and periods, which are invalid in Kubernetes.
<2> A topic name alias that works in Kubernetes.

If more than one `KafkaTopic` resource refers to the same Kafka topic, the resource that was created first is considered to be the one managing the topic. 
The status of the newer resources is updated to indicate a conflict, and their status is changed to `False`.

If a Kafka client application, such as Kafka Streams, automatically creates topics with invalid Kubernetes resource names, the Topic Operator generates a valid `metadata.name`. 
It replaces invalid characters and appends a hash to the name.

.Example of replacing an invalid topic name
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]

apiVersion: {KafkaTopicApiVersion}
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: my-topic---c55e57fe2546a33f9e603caf57165db4072e827e
