= Configuring Cluster Operator logging

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster Operator logging is controlled through a `ConfigMap` named `strimzi-cluster-operator`.

This `ConfigMap` is created with default values during installation and is described in the file: `install/cluster-operator/050-ConfigMap-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml`.

To update the logging configuration, you can do one of the following:

* Edit the YAML file and reapply it:
[source,shell]
kubectl create -f install/cluster-operator/050-ConfigMap-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml
* Edit the `ConfigMap` directly:
[source,shell]
kubectl edit configmap strimzi-cluster-operator

Using this `ConfigMap`, you can control:

* Root logger level
* Log output format
* Log levels for different components
* Kafka `AdminClient` logging levels
* Netty logging Levels
* How often logging configuration is loaded

The `monitorInterval` setting determines how often, in seconds, the logging configuration is dynamically reloaded.
The default is 30 seconds.

If the `ConfigMap` is missing when the Cluster Operator is deployed, the default logging configuration is used.

If the `ConfigMap` is deleted after deployment, the most recently loaded logging configuration remains in effect.
Create a new `ConfigMap` to load a new logging configuration.

WARNING: Do not remove the `monitorInterval` option from the `ConfigMap`.
