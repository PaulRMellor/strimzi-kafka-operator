= Kafka rack awareness

The rack awareness feature in Strimzi helps to spread the Kafka broker pods and Kafka topic replicas across different racks.
Enabling rack awareness helps to improve availability of Kafka brokers and the topics they are hosting.

NOTE: A _rack_ can represent an availability zone, data center, or an actual rack in your data center.

For more information on configuring rack awareness, see xref:type-Rack-reference[].
