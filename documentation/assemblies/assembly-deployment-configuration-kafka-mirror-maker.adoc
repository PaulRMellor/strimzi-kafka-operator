:context: deployment-configuration-kafka-mirror-maker

This chapter describes how to configure a Kafka MirrorMaker deployment in your cluster.

You can use {ProductName} with MirrorMaker or {MirrorMaker}.

[discrete]
== MirrorMaker

If you are using MirrorMaker, you configure the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource.

The following procedure shows how the resource is configured:

* xref:configuring-kafka-mirror-maker-{context}[Configuring Kafka MirrorMaker]

Supported properties are also described in more detail for your reference:

* xref:con-configuring-mirror-maker-{context}[Kafka MirrorMaker configuration properties]

The full schema of the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaMirrorMaker-reference[KafkaMirrorMaker schema reference].

NOTE: Labels applied to a `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources comprising Kafka MirrorMaker.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.

[discrete]
== {MirrorMaker}

If you are using {MirrorMaker}, you configure the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource.

{MirrorMaker} introduces an entirely new way of replicating data in clusters.

As a result, the resource configuration differs from the previous version of MirrorMaker.
If you choose to use {MirrorMaker}, there is currently no legacy support, so any resources must be manually converted into the new format.

How {MirrorMaker} replicates data is described here:

* xref:con-mirrormaker-{context}[{MirrorMaker} data replication]

The following procedure shows how the resource is configured for {MirrorMaker}:

* xref:proc-mirrormaker-replication-{context}[Synchronizing data between Kafka clusters]

The full schema of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaMirrorMaker2-reference[KafkaMirrorMaker2 schema reference].
