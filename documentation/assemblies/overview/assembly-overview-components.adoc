= {ProductName} components

Having discussed the basics of Kafka, we can now look at how {ProductName} supports a deployment of Kafka using:

* *Operators* to deploy and manage the components and dependencies to Kubernetes
* *Kafka Bridge* to make HTTP-based requests to the Kafka cluster

Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application.
{ProductName} Operators extend Kubernetes functionality, automating common and complex tasks related to a Kafka deployment.
Using the Operators, Kafka administration tasks are simplified and require less manual intervention.
