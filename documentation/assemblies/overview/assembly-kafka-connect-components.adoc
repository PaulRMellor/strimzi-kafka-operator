= About Kafka Connect

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems.
The other system is typically an external data source or target, such as a database.

Kafka Connect uses a plugin architecture.
Plugins allow connections to other systems and provide additional configuration to manipulate data.
Plugins include _connectors_ and other components, such as data converters and transforms.
A connector operates with a specific type of external system.
Each connector defines a schema for its configuration.
You supply the configuration to Kafka Connect to create a _connector instance_ within Kafka Connect.
Connector instances define a set of tasks to move data between systems.

Strimzi operates Kafka Connect in _distributed mode_, distributing data streaming tasks across worker pods.
A Kafka Connect cluster comprises a group of worker pods.
A single worker instantiates a connector, but tasks are distributed across the group.
Distribution across workers creates highly scalable pipelines.

Workers convert data into the correct format for the target system.
Depending on the configuration of the connector instance, workers might also apply transforms (also known as Single Message Transforms, or SMTs).
Transforms adjust messages, such as filtering certain data, before they are converted.
Kafka Connect has some built-in transforms, but other transformations can be provided by plugins if necessary.
