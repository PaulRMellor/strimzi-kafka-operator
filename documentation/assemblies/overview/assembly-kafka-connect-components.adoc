= About Kafka Connect

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems.
The other system is typically an external data source or target, such as a database.

Connector plugins allow you to configure the implementation required for connecting to a specific type of external system.
Kafka Connect creates instances of connector plugins from the configuration provided.
Connector instances define a set of tasks to move data between systems.

A Kafka Connect cluster comprises a group of workers.
Workers perform the work to move data.
A single worker instantiates a connector, but tasks are distributed across the group.
Distribution across workers creates highly scalable pipelines.

Workers convert data into the correct format for the target system.
Depending on the configuration of the connector instance, workers might also apply transforms.
Transforms adjust messages, such as filtering certain data, before they are converted.
