[id="configuration-points_{context}"]
= {ProductName} configuration

A deployment of {ProductName} to a Kubernetes cluster is highly configurable through the application of custom resources.
Custom resources are created as instances of custom resource definitions (CRDs) to  extend Kubernetes resources.

CRDs act as configuration instructions to describe the custom resources in a Kubernetes cluster, and are provided with {ProductName} for each component used in a deployment.
CRDs and custom resources are defined as YAML files.
Example YAML files are provided with the {ProductName} distribution.

In this chapter we look at how components are configured through custom resources, some common configuration points, and important configuration options specific to components.
