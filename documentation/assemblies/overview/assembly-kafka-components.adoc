= Kafka components

Kafka's supporting components are provided for deployment to Kubernetes with the {ProductName} distribution.
The Kafka components are generally run as clusters for availability.

A typical deployment incorporating Kafka and its supporting components might include:

* *Kafka* cluster of broker nodes
* *ZooKeeper* cluster of replicated ZooKeeper instances
* *Kafka Connect* cluster for external data connections
* *Kafka MirrorMaker* cluster to mirror the Kafka cluster in a secondary cluster
* *Kafka Exporter* to extract Kafka metrics data for monitoring.
