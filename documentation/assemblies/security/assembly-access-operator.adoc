= Using the Access Operator to manage client connections (early access)

[role="_abstract"]
The Strimzi Access Operator simplifies how applications connect to a Kafka cluster managed by the Cluster Operator. 
The Access Operator is deployed separately and manages the distribution of connection details, which are stored as a `Secret` resource. 
The secret contains user credentials and cluster connection details, and can be referenced by applications across different namespaces.

WARNING: The Access Operator is an early access feature and is not recommended for production environments.
