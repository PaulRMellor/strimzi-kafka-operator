= Scaling clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Scaling Kafka clusters by adding can increase the performance and reliability of the cluster. 
Adding more brokers increases available resources, allowing the cluster to handle larger workloads and process more messages. 
It can also improve fault tolerance by providing more replicas and backups. 
Conversely, removing underutilized brokers can reduce resource consumption and improve efficiency. 
Scaling must be done carefully to avoid disruption or data loss.

When scaling brokers in a Kafka cluster, it's necessary to reassign partitions for any existing topics. 
The `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` tool can be used to reassign partitions and improve performance by balancing the distribution of partitions across brokers, though its primary purpose is to change the replication factor of a topic, as this cannot be done any other way.
The most efficient way to reassign partitions is using xref:cruise-control-concepts-str[Cruise Control for cluster rebalancing]. 
Cruise Control automates partition reassignments and can be used to move topics from one broker to another without any downtime.
