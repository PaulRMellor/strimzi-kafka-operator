= Using the partition reassignment tool

[role="_abstract"]
When scaling a Kafka cluster, you may need to add or remove brokers and update the distribution of partitions or the replication factor of topics. 
To update partitions and topics, you can use the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` tool.

Changing the replication factor of a topic cannot be done using any other Kafka tools. 
You must use `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` to do this. 

The tool can also be used to reassign partitions and balance the distribution of partitions across brokers to improve performance.
However, it is recommended to use xref:cruise-control-concepts-str[Cruise Control for automated partition reassignments and cluster rebalancing]. 
Cruise Control can move topics from one broker to another without any downtime, and it is the most efficient way to reassign partitions.
