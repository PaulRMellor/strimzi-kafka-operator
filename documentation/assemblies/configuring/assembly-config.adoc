= Configuring a deployment

[role="_abstract"]
Configure and manage a Strimzi deployment to your precise needs using Strimzi custom resources.
Strimzi provides example custom resources with each release, allowing you to configure and create instances of supported Kafka components.
Fine-tune your deployment by configuring custom resources to include additional features according to your specific requirements. 
For specific areas of configuration, namely metrics, logging, and external configuration for Kafka Connect connectors, you can also use `ConfigMap` resources.
By using a `ConfigMap` resource to incorporate configuration, you centralize maintenance. 
You can also use configuration providers to load configuration from external sources, which we recommend for supplying the credentials for Kafka Connect connector configuration.

Use custom resources to configure and create instances of the following components:

* Kafka clusters
* Kafka Connect clusters
* Kafka MirrorMaker
* Kafka Bridge
* Cruise Control

You can also use custom resource configuration to manage your instances or modify your deployment to introduce additional features.
This might include configuration that supports the following:

* Securing client access to Kafka brokers
* Accessing Kafka brokers from outside the cluster
* Creating topics
* Creating users (clients)
* Controlling feature gates
* Changing logging frequency
* Allocating resource limits and requests
* Introducing features, such as Strimzi Drain Cleaner, Cruise Control, or distributed tracing.

The link:{BookURLConfiguring}[Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference^] describes the properties you can use in your configuration.
