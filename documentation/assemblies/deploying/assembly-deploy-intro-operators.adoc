= Strimzi operators

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi uses operators to deploy and manage Kafka components.
The operators monitor Strimzi custom resources (like `Kafka`, `KafkaTopic`, and `KafkaUser`) and ensure that the Kafka components are configured and running as specified in the resources.

Strimzi provides the following operators, each handling different aspects of a Kafka deployment:

Cluster Operator (required):: Handles the deployment and management of Apache Kafka clusters on Kubernetes. It automates the setup of Kafka nodes, and other Kafka components and resources.
Entity Operator (recommended):: Incorporates the following to manage topics and users:
* *Topic Operator* for managing Kafka topics.
* *User Operator* for managing Kafka users.
ifdef::Section[]
Access Operator (optional):: Helps manage and share Kafka cluster connection details.
endif::Section[]

Additionally, Strimzi provides Drain Cleaner, which supports the Cluster Operator in managing pod evictions for Kafka clusters.

The Cluster Operator is required and must be deployed first.
It handles the deployment of Kafka and, if configured, can also deploy the Entity Operator, which may include the Topic Operator, User Operator, or both.

The Topic Operator and User Operator can also be deployed standalone to manage topics and users for a Kafka cluster that is not managed by Strimzi.
