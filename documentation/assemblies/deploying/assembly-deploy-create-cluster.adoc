= Create the Kafka cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To manage a Kafka cluster with the Cluster Operator, you deploy it as a `Kafka` resource.
Strimzi provides example deployment files to do this.
You can use these files to deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator at the same time.

Alternatively, you can deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator as standalone components.
You would do this if you are not using the Cluster Operator to manage a Kafka cluster.
For example, when a Kafka cluster is running outside of Kubernetes.

NOTE: The Cluster Operator can watch one, multiple, or all namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster.
The Topic Operator and Cluster Operator watch for `KafkaTopics` and `KafkaUsers` in the single namespace of the Kafka cluster deployment.
