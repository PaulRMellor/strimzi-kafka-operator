Configures an external listener to expose Kafka using OpenShift `Routes` and the HAProxy router.
A dedicated `Route` is created for every Kafka broker pod.
An additional `Route` is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address.
Kafka clients can use these `Routes` to connect to Kafka on port 443.

By default, TLS encryption is not enabled.
TLS encryption is always used with `Routes`, so the `tls` property must be set to `true`.
