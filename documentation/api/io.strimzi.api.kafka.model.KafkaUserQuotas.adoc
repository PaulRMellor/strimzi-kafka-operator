Kafka allows a user to set `quotas` to control the use of resources by clients.

=== `quotas`

You can configure your clients to use the following types of quotas:

* _Network usage_ quotas specify the byte rate threshold for each group of clients sharing a quota.
* _CPU utilization_ quotas specify the percentage of time a client can utilize on request handler I/O threads and network threads of each broker within a quota window
* _Partition mutation_ quotas limit the number of partition mutations allowed per second.

The partition mutation quota prevents Kafka clusters from being overwhelmed by concurrent topic operations.
The number of partition mutations includes the following types of user requests:

* Creating partitions for a new topic
* Adding partitions to an existing topic
* Deleting partitions from a topic

You can configure a mutation rate quota to control the rate at which mutations are accepted for user requests.

Using quotas for Kafka clients might be useful in a number of situations.
Consider a wrongly configured Kafka producer which is sending requests at too high a rate.
Such misconfiguration can cause a denial of service to other clients, so the problematic client ought to be blocked.
By using a network limiting quota, it is possible to prevent this situation from significantly impacting other clients.

Strimzi supports user-level quotas, but not client-level quotas.
