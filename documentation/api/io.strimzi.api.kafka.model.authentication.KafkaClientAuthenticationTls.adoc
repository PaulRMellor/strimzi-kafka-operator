To use TLS client authentication, set the `type` property to the value `tls`.
TLS client authentication uses a TLS certificate to authenticate.

=== `certificateAndKey`

The certificate is specified in the `certificateAndKey` property and is always loaded from a Kubernetes secret.
In the secret, the certificate must be stored in X509 format under two different keys: public and private.

You can use the secrets created by the Cluster Operator for the Kafka cluster,
or you can create your own TLS certificate file, then create a `Secret` from the file:

[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl create secret generic _MY-SECRET_ \
--from-file=_MY-TLS-CERTIFICATE-FILE.crt_

NOTE: TLS client authentication can only be used with TLS connections.
