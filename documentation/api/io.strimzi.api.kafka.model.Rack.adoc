Configures rack awareness to spread replicas across different racks.

By configuring a `rack` for a Kafka cluster, consumers are allowed to fetch data from the closest replica.
This is useful when a Kafka cluster spans multiple datacenters.

A `topologyKey` value must match the label of the cluster node used by Kubernetes when scheduling Kafka broker pods to nodes.

If the Kubernetes cluster is running on a cloud provider platform, that label should represent the availability zone where the node is running.
Usually, nodes are labeled with the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label (or `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` on older Kubernetes versions),
which can be used as the `topologyKey` value.

This has the effect of spreading the broker pods across zones, and also setting the brokers' `broker.rack` configuration parameter inside Kafka broker.
Consult your Kubernetes administrator regarding the node label that represents the zone or rack into which the node is deployed.
