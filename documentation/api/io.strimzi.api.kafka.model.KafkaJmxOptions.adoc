Configures JMX connection options.

JMX metrics are obtained from Kafka brokers, Kafka Connect, and MirrorMaker 2.0 by opening a JMX port on 9999.
Use the `jmxOptions` property to configure a password-protected JMX port, to prevent unauthorized pods from accessing the port,
or an unprotected JMX port.

You can then obtain metrics about the component.

For example, for each Kafka broker you can obtain usage data in terms of bytes per second from clients,
or the request rate of the network of the broker.

To enable security for the JMX port, set the `type` parameter in the `authentication` field to `password`.

.Example password-protected JMX configuration
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    jmxOptions:
      authentication:
        type: "password"
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
----

You can then deploy a pod into a cluster and obtain JMX metrics using the headless
service by specifying which broker you want to address.

For example, to get JMX metrics from broker _0_ you specify:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
"_CLUSTER-NAME_-kafka-0._CLUSTER-NAME_-_brokers_"
----

If the JMX port is secured, you can get the username and password by referencing them from the JMX secret in the
deployment of your pod.

For an unprotected JMX port, use an empty object `{}` to open the JMX port on the headless service.
You deploy a pod and obtain metrics in the same way as for the protected port, but in this case any pod can read from the JMX port.

.Example open port JMX configuration
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    jmxOptions: {}
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
