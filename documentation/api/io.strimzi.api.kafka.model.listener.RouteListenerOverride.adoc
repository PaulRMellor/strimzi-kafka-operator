Configures overrides for route external listeners.

[id='property-route-listener-overrides-{context}']
.`overrides`

By default, the route hosts are automatically assigned by OpenShift.
However, you can override the assigned route hosts by specifying the requested hosts in the `overrides` property.

Strimzi does not perform any validation that the requested hosts are available; you must ensure that they are free and can be used.
